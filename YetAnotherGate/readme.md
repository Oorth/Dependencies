## Overview

Hi, this project aims on bypassing every usermode AV/EDR via using syscall trampolines and generating dynamically obsfuscated syscall stubs....
Here I am taking the SSN numbers and Address of the syscall command for every function you desire..
It will then generate a syscall stub pool in memory, and every syscall stub will look different due to their dynamically obsfuscated nature (~2000 different possible stubs)
>~~Goodluck writing static rules for that script kiddies~~

## Usage
Implimenting it in your code is also very easy, all you have to do is add these to your code ->

```markdown
    struct Sys_stb
    {
        const char* function_name;
        DWORD SSN;
        size_t stubsize;
        void* pStubAddress;
        BYTE* pCleanSyscall;
    };

    size_t numSyscalls = 0;
    syscallEntries[numSyscalls++] = {"NtWriteFile", 0, 0, nullptr, nullptr};
    syscallEntries[numSyscalls++] = {"NtCreateFile", 0, 0, nullptr, nullptr};
                                    .
                                    .
                                    .
    
    AddStubToPool(syscallEntries, numSyscalls);
```

and to call the function all you have to do is..

```markdown
    void* status = SysFunction("NtWriteFile", GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE), nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, &ioStatusBlock, buffer, length, nullptr, nullptr);
```

just pass the correct ntfunction name and, the correct parameters, it will handle the dynamic number of parameters all by itself
function returns 
```markdown
>    (void*)(~0ull);
```
if anything goes wrong and also
```markdown
>    std::cout << "Status: 0x" << std::hex << status << std::endl;
```
If you messup somewhere :)

##LIMITATION
I ASSUME WE HAVE A CLEAN UNHOOKED NTDLL.DLL, WORKING ON WAYS TO GET THE UNHOOKED NTDLL SILENTLY SOMEHOW IN AN AV/EDR INFESTED ENVIRONMENTS.
ideas are welcomed..

Currently using methods to get clean unhooked ntdll.dll ->
    1) KnownDlls  [Done as a Fallback]
    2) Blind Side [Need to code]
    3) Guard Page fault and VEH [Exploring]
        -> Guard page fault seeme like higher probability if getting flagged they, generate conspicuous exception and ETW events that many EDRs will flag, especially when placed on system-image regions [https://redops.at/en/blog/edr-analysis-leveraging-fake-dlls-guard-pages-and-veh-for-enhanced-detection]
        Some EDRs Load fake ntdll.dll and KERNEL32.dll before the original ones..... and make an vectored exception handler

## The End
So people have fun stay safe, If you have further ideas go on I am all ears.
